As you can understand after a months closure and the festive period upon us it’s a very busy time! We will be contacting all clients who had a pre booked appointment before lockdown first then any available appointments left to first come basis !

So we will ask once again for your kind patience in this matter and both myself and Rayne will endeavour to look after you all where possible !

We both hope you have and continue to stay safe and well during this awful year and both myself and Rayne are looking forward to seeing you all again !
